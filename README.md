# Service-station admin app

This app can be used to automate everyday work of an administrator at a service station.
This example requires a REST server to provide data. Use [fake JSON server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) to test it.

## Installation

- Clone the repo.
- Install [JSON server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) 

```bash
npm install -g json-server
```

and Start it 

```bash
$ json-server --watch db.json
```

-  Now you can open the `index.html` file and test the app.
